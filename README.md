# Clue board game
Cluedo, known as Clue in North America, is a murder mystery game that was devised in 1943 by Anthony E. Pratt.

The object of the game is to determine who murdered the game's victim, where the crime took place, and which weapon was used. Each player assumes the role of one of the suspects and attempts to deduce the correct answer by strategically moving around a game board representing the rooms of a mansion and collecting clues about the circumstances of the murder from the other players. In this version of the game, Mr. Black has been murdered by one of the tools in the game in an unknown room.
